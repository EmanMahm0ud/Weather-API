# Weather-Journal App Project
The second project from Udacity Front End Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program.

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the temperature of a certain zip code city.
